# Youtube-Keyword-Analyzer
Created with a bunch of Python libraries and Javascript, this is a search engine used to find the current popularity or trend of a certain keyword being used in Youtube's most popular videos. An upwards trend of a certain keyword denotes that the keyword is becoming more popular (attracting more attention) in the past 7 days. The algorithm used to evaluate the "trendiness" of a certain keyword is based on the Youtube Search Function, where if a certain keyword is popular enough, the first results when the keyword is used to search videos in Youtube will result in videos with higher viewcounts. Of course, results are based only on videos that are uploaded in the past week and analyzed properly in chronological order.

# Instructions to use:
1. Make sure that you have set up your Node.js environment. If you have not, you can download the latest version from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org). Once installed, you can open your terminal and verify the installation by typing `node -v`
2. Go to the directory in which all the cloned files are located, and type in `node app.js` in your terminal. If you've done so, you should get a console response in the form of `Server is running on port XXXX` where XXXX is your port number.
3. Open up your favourite web browser, and paste `http://localhost:3000/`, replace `3000` with whatever was your port number displayed in your terminal.
4. If you've done all of these steps properly, you should be in the following page:

6. After pressing Enter, you should be directed to another page, in this case showing the popularity trend of the keyword "Hong Kong" in Youtube.

#Notes:
Note that the "Trending Words" tab on the bottom right and the "compare" field is not currently functional. I'm not sure if I'm continuing this project, I've been way too busy with school and have not touched it in months.
